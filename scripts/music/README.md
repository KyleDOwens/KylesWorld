# Scripts
This section contains scripts that aid me in organizing my music. These mostly use the Spotify API to interface with my playlists.


# How-To
## General notes before making changes
* Edit `download_album_art.py` to make sure it is referencing the correct year and playlist ID. This only needs to be done once per year
* Edit `create_organized_playlist.py` to make sure it is referencing the correct year and playlist ID. This only needs to be done once per year
* Edit `pull_songs_list.py` to make sure it is referencing the correct year and playlist ID 
* Edit `NEWEST_YEAR` in `scipts/build.py` to match the new year


## Update the albums list
Use `auto_pull_albums.sh`. This pulls from my "Organized Playlist 20XX" playlist on Spotify and updates the website to match that.
1) Run `./scripts/music/auto_pull_albums.sh`


## Update the songs list
Use `pull_songs_list.py`. This will pull all the songs from my Spotify "Songs 20XX" playlist and put them in the year's song CSV
1) Run `./scripts/music/auto_pull_songs.sh`

# Individual scripts documentation
## create_organized_playlist.py
This script creates a new organized playlist in the same order as the year's matching CSV file.

### How to use
0) Make sure the unorganized Spotify playlist has all the same songs/albums that are in `csv/<year>.csv`
1) Go to the overall albums playlist for the desired year. Click `Share` and `Copy Link to Playlist`.
2) Paste the playlist link into any text field. Look at the link, and note the PlaylistID, which is the value between `/playlist/` and `?si=`. 
    - For example, the PlaylistID for the link `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1dMXP1fy7ylPeqJh4i4o41?si=7c4c7e720bc340df` is `1dMXP1fy7ylPeqJh4i4o41`
3) Open the script in a text editor. Edit the variable value for `PLAYLIST_ID` to match your playlist, and update the `YEAR` to match your desired year
    - This should only have to be done once a year when making a new "Year 20XX" playlist
4) This script **NEEDS TO RUN IN WINDOWS**, so from WSL it must be run by: `powershell.exe -Command "python '\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu\\home\\kyledowens\\projects\\kyles_world\\scripts\\music\\create_organized_playlist.py'"`


### Things to note
* This needs to be run in the `scripts/` directory so the file paths work correctly

## download_album_art.py
The goal of this script is to automate the process of downloading album art images.

### How to use
1) Go to the playlist you want to download the album arts from in Spotify. Click `Share` and `Copy Link to Playlist`
2) Paste the playlist link into any text field. Look at the link, and note the PlaylistID, which is the value between `/playlist/` and `?si=`. 
    - For example, the PlaylistID for the link `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1dMXP1fy7ylPeqJh4i4o41?si=7c4c7e720bc340df` is `1dMXP1fy7ylPeqJh4i4o41`
3) Open the script in a text editor. Edit the variable value for `PLAYLIST_ID` to match your playlist, and update the `OUTPUT_DIR` to match your desired location
    - This should only have to be done once a year when making a new "Year 20XX" playlist
4) This script can't run from in WSL, so run it by: `powershell.exe -Command "python '\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu\\home\\kyledowens\\projects\\kyles_world\\scripts\\music\\download_album_art.py'"`

### Things to note
* This script **will not** re-download existing images.
* Some manual edits may need to be made to the images. To check if this is needed, go onto the website with the console open, and check for errors when loading the grid.
    - These edits will almost always be for albums that either (1) have multiple artists, or (2) are made by artists with a comma in their name (e.g. Tyler, the Creator). For those cases, the HTML will always cut off at the first comma of the first artist. So, abbreviate "Tyler, the Creator" to just "Tyler". Just to double check, look for the path that is in the console error message to see what it should be.
    - Another possible error case is when the actual year an album came out differs from the year Spotify thinks the album came out.

## pull_songs_list.py
Pulls the info from my Spotify songs list, and creates the corresponding "_songs" CSV

### How to use
1) Go to the playlist you want to download the album arts from in Spotify. Click `Share` and `Copy Link to Playlist`
2) Paste the playlist link into any text field. Look at the link, and note the PlaylistID, which is the value between `/playlist/` and `?si=`. 
    - For example, the PlaylistID for the link `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1dMXP1fy7ylPeqJh4i4o41?si=7c4c7e720bc340df` is `1dMXP1fy7ylPeqJh4i4o41`
3) Open the script in a text editor. Edit the variable value for `PLAYLIST_ID` to match your playlist, and update the `YEAR` to match your desired year
    - This should only have to be done once a year when making a new "Year 20XX" playlist
4) This script **NEEDS TO RUN IN WINDOWS**, so from WSL it must be run by: `powershell.exe -Command "python '\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu\\home\\kyledowens\\projects\\kyles_world\\scripts\\music\\pull_songs_list.py'"`


### Things to note
* The output CSV path **NEEDS** to be one of the `csv/` albums files with a year in its name
